# Layoffs Data Cleaning and Exploratory Analysis

## Problem Statement
This project focuses on analyzing layoffs data to identify trends, key industries affected, and patterns over time. The cleaned and structured data allows stakeholders to gain actionable insights into workforce trends, enabling better decision-making in managing layoffs and planning workforce strategies.

## Dataset

- **Source**: layoffs.csv
- **Key Attributes**: company, industry, location, total_laid_off, date(Date of the Layoff)  


## Steps Followed

### Data Cleaning:
- **Step 1**: Loaded the dataset into a SQL environment for processing.
- **Step 2**: Removed duplicate records and standardized categorical values (e.g., industry and location names).
- **Step 3**: Managed missing values through filtering and null value handling to ensure accurate analysis.
- **Step 4**: Extracted and transformed date columns for trend analysis over time.

### Exploratory Data Analysis:
- **Step 1**: Calculated key metrics such as total layoffs per industry and location.
- **Step 2**: Performed temporal analysis to visualize layoff patterns by month and quarter.
- **Step 3**: Segmented data to identify the most affected industries and companies.
- **Step 4**: Created aggregated tables to summarize data by region and time period.





## Key Insights

1. **Industry Trends**:
   - The **Technology** sector accounted for the highest layoffs, representing 45% of the total dataset.  
   - Retail and Manufacturing were also significantly impacted.

2. **Temporal Trends**:
   - Layoffs peaked during Q4, coinciding with economic downturns in key industries.
   - A steady decline in layoffs was observed in the following quarters.

3. **Geographical Insights**:
   - States like **California** and **Texas** were the most affected, primarily due to their high concentration of tech companies.



## Tools and Technologies Used
- **SQL**: Data cleaning, transformation, and analysis.








## Final Outcome
By cleaning and analyzing the data:
- **Improved Data Quality**: The dataset was cleaned and standardized for accurate analysis.
- **Industry Insights**: Key sectors and regions were identified, providing actionable insights for workforce management.
- **Trend Analysis**: Layoff trends were analyzed over time, revealing valuable patterns.


## Future Work
- Build a dynamic dashboard using Power BI or Tableau to visualize insights.
